This Demo shows how to make tables responsive for different screen resolutions without hide columns using CSS and Media Queries.

- same as solution-02, but more columns
- assume each column width is 160px
- floated columns at end
- no javascript
- use media queries for different viewport size
- rem in media query based on default font size (1rem = 16px), even u set a ``font-size`` on `:root`
- use div as table
